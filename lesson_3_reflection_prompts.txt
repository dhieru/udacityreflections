When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is when my team mate works on the same project however he is at a different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So as not lose any of my changes which I have done and forgotten, good to manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are on the github. It is same as clones but it is cloning on the github. If we want to contribute to somebody else's project, on our computer,
we need to fork the repo and then clone it on our local desktop
Branches is done on a master, if we are working on a experimental feature

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
