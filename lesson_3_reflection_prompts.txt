When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is when my team mate works on the same project however he is at a different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So as not lose any of my changes which I have done and forgotten, good to manually
